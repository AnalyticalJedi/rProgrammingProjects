# rProgrammingProjects

This is the first capstone project I've worked on while working on my Data Analytics Certification from Coursera in 2022 in RStudio. 

  -  This is a capstone project entitled, "Bellabeat", where I was a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights discovered will then help guide the company's marketing strategy. The analysis will be presented to the Bellabeat executive team along with high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. NOTE: This is JUST a simulation, not a real company or position I've held.
  
  -  In this report, it looks to answer the following questions: 

     -  1: What are some trends in smart device usage?
     -  2: How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
     -  3: How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?


All data in this capstone project was pulled, cleaned, and analyzed from this data located here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit
